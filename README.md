# House Prices & Number of Rooms Prediction
## Machine Learning Semester Project University

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project focusing on **Classification and Regression** techniques for predicting house prices. The dataset consists of **160,000+ rows**, offering a comprehensive foundation for analyzing various house price trends and factors influencing them.

## Project Scope
This project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Classification:** Number of Rooms Prediction
2. **Regression:** Predicting the exact price of houses using multiple regression models.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises **160,000+ records** with various attributes such as:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
- Location
- And many more features influencing house prices.

## Methodologies Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding key patterns.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying significant features impacting house prices.
- **Model Training:**
  - **Classification Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network(ANN), etc.
  - **Regression Models:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network(ANN), etc.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics such as RÂ² Score, F1 Score Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
